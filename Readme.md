# Holiday Calculation Library

Utility library for calculating the dates of various holidays.

{explain why I built this}


## Holiday Class

## HolidayFactory

## Holiday Defition format (JSON)

## DateUtilities Class

(note: should I move these functions into the `Holiday` class? Or could the be useful outside of this purpose?) If I did make this change, I think they should remain as static methods rather than using the private fields.)

## Usage Examples

## Maven Dependency
(once this is in maven)
